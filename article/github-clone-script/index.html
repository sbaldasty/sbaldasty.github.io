Integration with GitHub. Script for cloning repositories into a consistent directory structure.</div><h1>Git installation notes</h1><p>Years ago, <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a> won a popularity contest and become the standard tool for source code management and sharing. Linux distributions like <a href="https://https://system76.com/pop/" target="blank_">Pop!_OS</a> have it installed by default; but any Debian-based distribution can install it with <a class="tech" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/apt-command-in-linux-with-examples/" target="blank_" title="One of too many Linux package managers">apt</a>.</p><pre class="snippet">sudo apt install git</pre><p>You don't need more than that if you just want to clone repositories, but if you want to contribute code of your own, then some configuration helps. You can set the name and email address associated with the commits you make.</p><pre class="snippet">git config --global user.name &#34;Steven Baldasty&#34;
git config --global user.email &#34;example@bitflippin.com&#34;</pre><p>The default branch for new repositories used to be called <code>master</code>, but preference has since shifted to <code>main</code>. You can set the name of the default branch explicitly for repositories you create in the future during this transition period.</p><pre class="snippet">git config --global init.defaultBranch &#34;main&#34;</pre><p>If <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a> has become the standard version control tool, then <a href="https:github.com" target="blank_">GitHub</a> has become the standard place to store source code in the cloud - although it certainly has competitors. The smoothest way I have found to interact with GitHub repositories is by using <a class="tech" href="https://www.uvm.edu/vacc/docs/start_guide/ssh" target="blank_" title="Opens secure shells on remote systems">ssh</a> keys. I like to generate separate keypairs for every service I interact with, and for every device I interact with the service from.</p><pre class="snippet">ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &#34;you@example.com&#34;
# I enter &#39;github_ed25519&#39; when prompted for a name</pre><p>This generates a private key <code>~/.ssh/github_ed25519</code> which you keep secret, and a public key <code>~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub</code> which you upload to GitHub. See GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh" target="blank_">guide</a> for more information about how to upload your public key.</p><p>When you clone repositories, you may notice have a choice between the <code>https</code> or <code>git@github</code> option. The second lets you push changes with your key, but the first does not; I never use <code>https</code>.</p><p>I like to organize the repositories I clone using a consistent directory structure. I have <code>~/Code/github</code> (because I sometimes use other services besides GitHub), and subdirectories under that for users, and subdirectories under users for repositories. I use this script for convenience.</p><pre class="snippet">#!/bin/bash
set -e

if ! [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
   echo &#34;Requires 2 parameters.&#34;
   exit 1

d=$HOME/Code/github/$1
mkdir -p $d
git clone git@github.com:$1/$2.git $d/$2</pre><p>I named the script <code>ghclone.sh</code> and keep it in <code>~/bin</code>. To clone my <i>Hunt the Wumpus</i> applet for instance, I can run this from anywhere.</p><pre class="snippet">ghclone.sh sbaldasty wumpus-applet</pre><p>The script currently does not supply any help or clean up any files or directories it created if cloning the repository fails.</p></div><hr class="top-gapped"><div class="author"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Steven Baldasty</div><div class="caption">Proud father, Barefoot runner, Chocolate enthusiast, Seasoned software engineer, Starry eyed PhD student, Novice human</div></div><img src="/selfie.png" title="Sketch courtesy of my daughter" alt="Handsome brown haired man with glasses" width="80" height="88"></div></body></html>
