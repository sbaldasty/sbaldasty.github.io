Pictures from the Museum of Printing. Pictures from the New Hampshire Telephone Museum. Personal narrative. Inspired by an Information Theory course at UVM.</div><h1>Information theory in museums</h1><p>Imagine some text, sound, image, or video. Imagine transporting that media to another place or time. Encode the media as a sequence of symbols called a <i>message</i>. Set aside any notion of meaning the message represents. Send the message through a <i>channel</i> such as a telephone cable or hard drive. Recover the media by decoding the message.</p><p>How to measure the amount of <i>information</i> in the message? Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov describes three approaches in his paper <a href="https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/3520/Three%2Bapproaches%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bquantitative%2Bdefinition%2Bof%2Binformation.pdf" target="blank_">Three Approaches to the Quantitative Definition of Information</a>. A <i>combinatorial</i> approach counts how many symbols the message contains. A <i>probabilistic</i> approach called <i>Shannon Entropy</i> weights more heavily symbols which are <i>unlikely</i> to occur given what symbols have appeared before. An <i>algorithmic</i> approach called <i>Kolmogorov Complexity</i> measures the length of the shortest computer program that generates the message.</p><p>How to make the message as small as possible for efficiency? Most messages contain redundancy or patterns. Compression algorithms remove redundancy or patterns. <i>Lossless</i> compression preserves the message exactly, as one might require for text. <i>Lossy</i> compression shrinks the message more but also distorts it somewhat, as one might tolerate for sound or images.</p><p>How to protect the message from corruption due to <i>noise</i> in the channel that may randomly flip some of the bits? Ironically, now <i>add</i> redundancy; but add it in clever ways that allow for the detection and even correction of errors.</p><h2>A history, a theory, a flood</h2><p>In addition to the textbook, the Information Theory syllabus listed a less technical book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood" target="blank_">The Information</a> by James Gleick. It tells the story of humanity's accelerating dance with information with countless anecdotes from ancient history to the present day. Each advance brought profound societal changes, affecting lifestyle and thinking in ways people from before the technology could not understand.</p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Black statues in a courtyard of academic buildings at dusk" height="105" src="campus-at-dusk.jpg" title="UVM campus at dusk" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">UVM campus at dusk</div><div>Black ghostlike statues glide across the courtyard just before sunset, around when I stopped working and started graduate school. In warmer weather, students hang cozy hammocks between these trees.</div></div></div></div><p>These are some of my favorite stories.</p><ul><li><p>Two-pitched drums formed an unparalleled communications network between African villages for centuries. Drummers pounded out messages with drumbeats, adding lots of extra words to help listeners better sort through the unavoidable ambiguity in the system.</p></li><li><p>Writing emerged from ancient spoken languages and made it possible for information to pass unaltered through space and time.</p></li><li><p>Landowners in the American West created a large improvised telephone network through the barbed wire of their fences during the early days of telephony.</p></li><li><p>Robert Cawdrey compiled the first English dictionary. Early dictionaries served to <i>document</i> the words people were using, versus opining which words belonged in the English language and which did not. He also invented alphabetical ordering.</p></li><li><p>Before people harnessed electricity, Charles Babbage designed a mechanical general purpose computer. His collaborator Ada Lovelace worked out how to solve problems on it. Even though her programs could never run, she is widely considered the very first computer programmer.</p></li><li><p>Claude Shannon and other brilliant thinkers formalized information theory. They laid the theoretical foundations for modern electronic communication.</p></li></ul><p>After the class I visited two related museums with my parents. Spending time with historical artifacts from the worlds of printing and telephony brought to life for me a large swath of all that history.</p><h2>Museum of Printing</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.museumofprinting.org/" target="blank_">Museum of Printing</a> is in Haverhill, Massachusetts. It has hands-on exhibits and knowledgeable staff happy to answer questions and offer guided tours. From its About Page,</p><blockquote> The Museum of Printing is dedicated to preserving the rich history of the graphic arts, printing and typesetting technology, and printing craftsmanship. In addition to many special collections and small exhibits, the Museum contains hundreds of antique printing, typesetting, and bindery machines, as well as a library of books and printing-related documents. </blockquote><p>Someone even walked me through the process of making a cast of my name from a light molten metal in the same way an operator would prepare a page for mass production. After printing enough copies, they could melt the cast down again and reuse the metal for another page, but I got to keep my name!</p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Wheel of symbols used for printing" height="105" src="ancient-chinese-printing.jpg" title="Ancient chinese printing technology" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Ancient chinese printing technology</div><div>Symbols were selected from this wheel and used in something like a printing press.

I recommend visiting the museum to anyone interested learning about the history of telegraphs and telephones or seeing firsthand some of the artifacts on which our communications infrastructure is built, past and present. It also has several hands-on demos: telegraphs, manual switchboards, automated switchboards, and early coin operated telephones. There is also a large room dedicated to the life of Alexander Bell.</p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Telegraph" height="105" src="telegraph-demo.jpg" title="Telegraph" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Telegraph</div><div>Before telephones, there were telegraphs.

It spurs economic development, forces change, raises questions of justice, and creates barriers of understanding between people who adapt and those who do not. The people who lived before the telegraph could likely understand very little of our lives. Barring global catastrophe, technological progress will only continue. We will likely understand very little of the lives of the people who come next.</p></div><hr class="top-gapped"><div class="author"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Steven Baldasty</div><div class="caption">Proud father, Barefoot runner, Chocolate enthusiast, Seasoned software engineer, Starry eyed PhD student, Novice human</div></div><img src="/selfie.png" title="Sketch courtesy of my daughter" alt="Handsome brown haired man with glasses" width="80" height="88"></div></body></html>
