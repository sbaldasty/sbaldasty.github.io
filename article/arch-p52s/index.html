Reflections on starting and stopping Arch Linux for personal use. Ends with a working web browser. Mirrors online guides closely. Leaves several unanswered questions.</div><h1>Arch Linux on a Lenovo Thinkpad P52s</h1><p>Whether out of frustration with Microsoft Windows, for curiosity, fun, for a challenge, or to learn something new, many people make the decision to overwrite their factory installed operating system with something else. I experimented a lot with alternative operating systems over the years, and used Ubuntu regularly since 2007.</p><p>Well the mind wanders in unhealthy ways sometimes, and I found myself thinking too much about the past, and what could have been different about it. In particular, I thought of when I was a teenager with hundreds of dollars in cash from working my first summer job at a local amusement park. I bought a desktop computer with a Pentium Pro processor at a custom computer shop, and the owner let me help him build it.</p><p>I experimented obsessively with programming, the Internet, and FreeBSD; but what I found myself wondering was what else I could have done with access to more informational resources and confidence. Unable to draw my mind away from the storyline, I decided to turn my regret and fantasy into a present day hobby. What if I installed a challenging modern operating system on my laptop, and learned it as deeply as I could?</p><ul><li><p><b>Cool operating system.</b> I liked the modular design of Arch Linux that encouraged users to thoroughly research, understand, choose, and customize small components. The wiki was detailed and extensive, and the developers and maintainers had a reputation for being really good at what they did.</p></li><li><p><b>Learn about Linux.</b> Choosing and configuring small pieces meant a lot of learning. I wanted a deeper appreciation for what happened in my operating system.</p></li><li><p><b>Community fun.</b> Several of my friends used Arch already. I wanted to connect with them more. Having an unusual operating system in common could give us something to talk about. I wanted to explore new technologies together, share success stories, and troubleshoot issues.</p></li></ul><p>During the installation process, I drew from many online sources. They all have slightly different goals and focus areas. Many offer a useful generality and depth this document may lack, since I recorded only the steps I used to get Arch Linux running on my particular hardware. Having the latest installation image on a USB stick, I booted into the prompt...</p><h2>Disk partitions</h2><p>I used the <a class="tech" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fdisk" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">fdisk</a> utility to delete all the partitions on my disk and create two new ones. The first was an EFI partition for the bootloader. The second was a root partition for the operating system. Hopefully already well understood, but always worth mentioning, these instructions delete all data on the disk. The command line argument is the disk's device name. Device names vary by system.</p><pre class="snippet">fdisk /dev/nvme0n1</pre><p>The <a class="tech" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fdisk" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">fdisk</a> utility launches. It presents an interactive prompt.</p><ul><li><p><b>Delete any existing partitions.</b> Enter <kbd>d</kbd> and accept the default partition repeatedly until no partitions remain.</p></li><li><p><b>Create EFI partition.</b> Enter <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new partition. Enter <kbd>1</kbd> for the <i>partition number</i>. Accept the default <i>first sector</i>. Enter <kbd>+4G</kbd> for the <i>size</i>. Then <a class="tech" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fdisk" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">fdisk</a> returns to its top-level prompt. Enter <kbd>t</kbd> to set the partition type. Enter <kbd>1</kbd> for the <i>partition number</i>. Enter <kbd>uefi</kbd> for the <i>partition type</i>.</p></li><li><p><b>Create root partition.</b> Enter <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new partition. Enter <kbd>2</kbd> for the <i>partition number</i>. Accept the default <i>first sector</i>. Accept the default <i>size</i> to use all remaining disk space.</p></li><li><p><b>Write changes.</b> Optionally enter <kbd>p</kbd> to display the changes. Enter <kbd>w</kbd> to write the changes to disk. Then <a class="tech" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fdisk" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">fdisk</a> exits automatically.</p></li></ul><p>Two new devices <code>/dev/nvme0np1</code> and <code>/dev/nvme0np1</code> exist now, and correspond to the two new partitions.</p><p>I read about an interesting filesystem called <a class="tech" href="https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank_" title="Copy on write filesystem">btrfs</a> that supported snapshots, and I formatted the root partition with it. Unlike most partitions which normally get mounted directly, <a class="tech" href="https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank_" title="Copy on write filesystem">btrfs</a> partitions get broken down into subvolumes, and each subvolume gets mounted separately. However temporarily during the installation process, the partition itself gets mounted it for the purpose of creating the subvolumes. Good candidates are parts of the filesystem that contain large or rapidly changing data unimportant for system restoration purposes.</p><p>Create the subvolumes. The subvolumes appear under the partition's mount point as directories. Unmount the partition. Mount each of the subvolumes in its proper place. The <code>noatime</code> option improves performance by not tracking access times on files.</p><pre class="snippet"># Format the root partition

# Optionally take a snapshot
btrfs su snapshot /mnt /mnt/root/btrsnap/0000.base</pre><p>Enter into the new installation. Install <a class="tech" href="https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/iwd.wiki.kernel.org/" target="blank_" title="Standalone wireless daemon">iwd</a> and <a class="tech" href="https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv" target="blank_" title="Domain name resolver">openresolv</a> for internet access without help from the installation image, the text editor <a class="tech" href="https://www.vim.org/" target="blank_" title="Configurable text editor">vim</a> for editing configuration files, and <code>btrfs-progs</code> for taking system snapshots. Go through a number of mundane steps per the installation guide.</p><pre class="snippet">arch-chroot /mnt
pacman -S iwd openresolv vim btrfs-progs

# I didn&#39;t read up on what this does
hwclock --systohc

# Uncomment the appropriate UTF-8 line, generate locale(s)
vim /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen</pre><h2>Bootloader</h2><p>Install the necessary packages to make a <code>grub</code> bootloader. Then install the bootloader and set up its configuration. Consider saving the bootloader installation and configuration lines as a script for later use.</p><pre class="snippet">pacman -S grub efibootmgr
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi --bootloader-id=arch_grub
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

umount -R /mnt
reboot</pre><p>Remove the installation media and restart the laptop. If all goes well log in as <kbd>root</kbd>.</p><h2>Internet access</h2><p>The internet access I had in the installation media boot environment did not carry through when I booted into the operating system. I configured a wireless internet daemon <a class="tech" href="https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/iwd.wiki.kernel.org/" target="blank_" title="Standalone wireless daemon">iwd</a> and a domain name resolution service. For domain name resolution, I tried extensively to get <code>systemd-resolved</code> working but could not get past an issue where many names resolved but some did not, including the name of this site for instance. I switched to <code>resolvconf</code>.</p><p>On a single line in <code>/etc/hostname</code> assign the machine a hostname. For example the entire contents of the file could be <kbd>MyHostname</kbd>. Local applications can use the hostname to reference the machine.</p><pre class="snippet">vim /etc/hostname</pre><p>Per the Arch wiki, create the <code>resolv.conf</code> configuration file.</p><pre class="snippet">resolvconf -u</pre><p>There is no <a class="tech" href="https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/iwd.wiki.kernel.org/" target="blank_" title="Standalone wireless daemon">iwd</a> configuration file by default. Paste in this minimal configuration file when the time comes. This is <code>/etc/iwd/main.conf</code>.</p><pre class="snippet">[General]
EnableNetworkConfiguration=true

[Network]
NameResolvingService=resolvconf</pre><p>Start and enable the <a class="tech" href="https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/iwd.wiki.kernel.org/" target="blank_" title="Standalone wireless daemon">iwd</a> service. Starting the service launches it immediately. Enabling the servicec causes it to start automatically on boot. Connect to the internet wirelessly, replacing <kbd>MyNetwork</kbd> and <kbd>MyPassphrase</kbd> appropriately.</p><pre class="snippet"># Create the iwd config file
vim /etc/iwd/main.conf

# Start and enable iwd
systemctl enable iwd
systemctl start iwd

# Connect to a wireless network
iwctl --passphrase MyPassphrase station wlan0 connect MyNetwork

# Optionally view the network file that was created
cat /var/lib/iwd/MyNetwork.psk</pre><p>Further wireless refinements are possible and likely desirable. The installation guides I consulted contain additional network configuration recommendations I do not yet understand. Meanwhile these steps suffice to make the Arch installation usable.</p><h2>An everday user</h2><p>One usually creates a non-root user for regular operations. Even in cases where only one person uses the system, having a safeguard against accidentally running dangerous commands as root is nice.</p><p>I added a new user with a home directory and <a class="tech" href="https://ss64.com/bash/bash.html" target="blank_" title="Common shell for Linux">bash</a> for a login shell. Set the new user's password. Optionally exit the root session and test logging in as the new user.</p><pre class="snippet">useradd -m -s /bin/bash MyUsername
passwd MyUsername

# Optionally see the new home directory
ls /home</pre><p>The user should be able to become the root user when it needs to. Install the <a class="tech" href="https://www.sudo.ws/" target="blank_" title="Runs commands as the root user">sudo</a> package. Edit the <a class="tech" href="https://www.sudo.ws/" target="blank_" title="Runs commands as the root user">sudo</a> configuration file with the special <a class="tech" href="https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/1.8.13/visudo.man/" target="blank_" title="Special editor for the sudoers file">visudo</a> utility per below. Sources recommend doing otherwise, but editing <code>/etc/sudoers</code> directly also seems to work. Add the new user to the <code>wheel</code> group. Optionally test running commands as root by prefixing them with <a class="tech" href="https://www.sudo.ws/" target="blank_" title="Runs commands as the root user">sudo</a> when logged in as the new user.</p><pre class="snippet"># Install sudo
pacman -S sudo

# Uncomment the line &#34;%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL&#34;
EDITOR=vim visudo

usermod -a -G wheel MyUsername</pre><p>For convenience, the root user should have the ability to shut down and reboot the system without becoming the root user. Install the <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/polkit-org/polkit" target="blank_" title="Manages process authorizations">polkit</a> package.</p><pre class="snippet">pacman -S polkit</pre><p>Surprisingly without enabling any service the non-root user now has the ability to use the <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> commands. Perhaps they can now run other commands as well. There are certainly many things I still do not understand about <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/polkit-org/polkit" target="blank_" title="Manages process authorizations">polkit</a>.</p><h2>Graphical interface</h2><p>Chrome needs a graphical environment to run in, such as a wayland compositor like <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a>. Install <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a> and choose <code>gnu-free-fonts</code> when the installation process asks about a font. Other choices probably work fine. Also install <a class="tech" href="https://alacritty.org/" target="blank_" title="Terminal emulator">alacritty</a> which is a terminal for <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a>. Copy the default <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a> configuration file to the user home directory. Edit the configuration file to set <a class="tech" href="https://alacritty.org/" target="blank_" title="Terminal emulator">alacritty</a> as the default terminal. Launch sway. Open a terminal by pressing the <i>Win+Enter</i> keys together. Continue to the remaining steps in the <a class="tech" href="https://alacritty.org/" target="blank_" title="Terminal emulator">alacritty</a> terminal.</p><pre class="snippet"># Install sway and alacritty
sudo pacman -S sway alacritty

# Use the default sway configuration file
mkdir -p ~/.config/sway
cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway

# Change &#34;set $term foot&#34; to &#34;set $term alacritty&#34;
vim ~/.config/sway/config

# Launch sway
sway</pre><h2>Arch user repository</h2><p>Google Chrome and most other software of interest is not available through <a class="tech" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman" target="blank_" title="Package manager for Arch Linux">pacman</a>, only through the AUR. A straightforward way to use AUR is with the <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a> package. The most straightforward way to install <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a> is cloning it using <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a>.</p><p>Install <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a>. Optionally set the name for default branches. This avoids warning messages when cloning repositories. The common choice used to be <i>master</i> but recently seems to have shifted to <i>main</i>. Optionally set a <i>name</i> and <i>email</i> which will attribute authorship to future commits.</p><pre class="snippet">sudo pacman -S git

git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global user.name &#34;My Name&#34;
git config --global user.email &#34;myemail@bitflippin.com&#34;</pre><p>Clone the <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a> repository. Build and install <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a>. Once installed the repository is no longer necessary. Interestingly <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a> seems to install itelf as a <a class="tech" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="blank_" title="Arch user repository helper">yay</a> package!</p><pre class="snippet">git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
sudo pacman -S base-devel
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay</pre><h2>Google Chrome</h2><p>The last step to having a nice baseline system that can be further is having a web broser. I installed Google Chrome and ran it. On wayland the additional flag below may be necessary. It was for me.</p><pre class="snippet">yay -S google-chrome
google-chrome-stable --ozone-platform=wayland</pre><p>Usability gaps like having <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a> start on login, having <code>google-chrome-stable</code> launch without a terminal, and further customizations of <a class="tech" href="https://swaywm.org/" target="blank_" title="Tiling wayland compositor">sway</a> still remain; however these steps are sufficient to get started.</p><h2>Switching back again</h2><p>The installation process took a lot of time, but I also learned a lot. Despite some frustrations, it was also fun. I used Arch Linux for a while, building out useful scripts, and experimenting with splash screens.Going with Arch Linux had downsides too.</p><ul><li><p><b>Complicated mess.</b> I envisioned a collection of well designed designed and maintained components that could work togther nicely. Instead, the components had overlapping responsibilities, nonuniform methods of configuration, and interacted with each other in unpredictable ways. From the multiple package managers to wireless networking challenges, Arch Linux did not have the beautiful simplicity I hoped for.</p></li><li><p><b>Instability.</b> A recurring theme in reading the documentation and writings from people in the community is that it isn't necessarily a good idea to trust updates. Even routine updates can apparently often break the installation. Dealing with a broken system is not always compatible with productivity.</p></li><li><p><b>Maintenance time.</b> The installation process took a lot of time; but I expected that, and gaining a better understanding of the operating system and its components was all part of the adventure. An expectation about reading all the release notes to assess the impact of new package releases and to engage in ongoing troubleshooting was not.</p></li></ul><p>I dreamed of perfection when it came to a computer, but no computer is perfect. Buggy software with usability issues run on top of buggy operating systems that have design flaws that can sometimes manifest in strange ways. The hardware on which the the operating system runs has weaknesses too, from choices about the instruction set, to the chipset, to the peripherals.</p><p>Ultimately my laptop had to be a tool I could use productivity and without a lot of cognitive overhead; and other Linux distributions like Ubuntu require far less cognitive overhead.</p><h2>Helpful references</h2><p>I relied on a lot of guides and help to get as far as I did.
