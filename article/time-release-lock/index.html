    <h1>Time release lock</h1>
    <p>
        
    I found a healthier relationship to chocolate and other sugary snacks through the use of a <em>commitment device</em> that helped me make responsible choices on behalf of my future self.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I feel grateful to live in a time and place where food is abundant. In theory, I could enjoy eating just enough food. I could enjoy sharing meals with family and friends. I could enjoy the health benefits good nutrition brings. In practice, the draw toward delicious tastes is powerful. Sugar especially offers a strange temporarily escape from stress and sadness. In my younger years I ate chocolate by the bar. I ate ice cream by the carton. I ate it in the morning. I ate it alone at night. Together with aging and a more sedentary lifestyle, my choices began to affect energy level and mood. Eventually they began to affect my weight.</p>
    <p>Even though I wanted to eat less sugar, I could not control myself. Willpower helped somewhat. People encouraged me, which helped somewhat. I eventually learned about commitment devices - mechanisms that enabled people to make a choice in the present to limit what choices they have in the future. A time release lock is a classic example of a commitment device. It is a lock that requires no key or combination; instead, it opens automatically when a timer expires. Time release locks are often used to control access to cigarettes and addictive prescription medicines. They work well for junk food too.</p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>I buy any junk food I like and can find at an acceptable price. I keep it all in one container. Any container with a hole for the shackle of the lock to slip through would do, but I use a large repurposed toolbox. I had it on-hand, and it allows me lots of space. In the morning, I enjoy choosing a reasonable amount of junk food from the container to last me the day. I give myself plenty of leeway about what <em>reasonable</em> means. After all, I only want to avoid overindulgence, not to punish myself. After that I make my commitment by locking the container. I allow myself to eat my chosen junk food any time I want, but I usually eat some after breakfast and the rest after lunch.</p>

    &lt;p&gt;A photo will go here...&lt;/p&gt;

    </div>


    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>My future self sometimes experiences cravings. He sometimes feels upset that the rest the junk food is locked up. When that happens I take a little time to remember how my past self limited the choices I have now because he cared about me, and how in the morning I will get to choose more junk food and then make the same commitment all over again, limiting the choices my next future self will have because I care about him.</p>
