Commitment devices generally. Recommendations about materials and routine. Reflections on personal motivation and mindset. Links to several junk food favorites. </div><h1>Time release lock</h1><p> In other times and places, food is scarce. People lack access to the nutrients they need to survive and be healthy. I feel grateful that here and now, food is abundant. In theory, I could enjoy eating just enough food. I could enjoy sharing meals with family and friends. I could enjoy the health benefits good nutrition brings. In practice, the draw toward delicious tastes is powerful. Like many people, I sometimes eat too much. Sugar especially offers a strange temporarily escape from stress and sadness. </p><p> In younger years I ate chocolate by the bar. I ate ice cream by the carton. I ate it in the morning. I ate it alone at night. Together with aging and a more sedentary lifestyle, my choices began to affect energy level and mood. Eventually they began to affect my weight. Even though I wanted to eat less sugar, I couldn't control myself. Despite willpower and the encouragement of others, the restraint I showed in one moment completely collapsed in some not so distant future moment. </p><p> I eventually learned about commitment devices - mechanisms that enable people to make a choice in the present to limit what choices they have in the future. A time release lock is a classic example of a commitment device. It is a lock that requires no key or combination; instead, it opens automatically when a timer expires. Time release locks are often used to control access to cigarettes and addictive prescription medicines. They work well for junk food too. </p><h2>The new routine</h2><p> I buy any junk food I like and can find at an acceptable price. I keep it all in one container. Any container with a hole for the shackle of the lock to slip through would do, but I chose a large repurposed toolbox because it had lots of space. In the morning, I enjoy choosing a reasonable amount of junk food from the container to last me the day. I give myself plenty of leeway about what <em>reasonable</em> means. After all, I only want to avoid overindulgence, not to punish myself. After that I make my commitment by locking the container. I allow myself to eat my chosen junk food any time I want, but I usually eat some after breakfast and the rest after lunch. </p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Holding an open time release lock" height="105" src="open-time-release-lock.jpg" title="Basic features" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Basic features</div><div> I bought this time release lock on Amazon. It is sturdy and has worked reliably for several years. It has a simple digital display, and buttons for setting and starting the timer. It beeps, but the beeping can be silenced. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Open toolbox filled with chocolate and other candy" height="105" src="toolbox-of-chocolate.jpg" title="Stocking the container" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Stocking the container</div><div> I restock infrequently to minimize my free access to junk food; but when I do, I usually fill the container completely. This way I can also take advantage of good sales and bulk deals. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Closed time release lock with timer set to 20 hours" height="105" src="time-release-lock-timer.jpg" title="Setting the timer" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Setting the timer</div><div> I set the timer for about 20 hours. The lock releases overnight, giving me flexibility around when to collect junk food in the morning. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="USB-B charging port on the bottom of a time release lock" height="105" src="time-release-lock-charging-port.jpg" title="Charging port" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Charging port</div><div> I charge through a USB cable every couple months. If the battery runs out of charge, the lock cannot open again until it is at least partially recharged. </div></div></div></div><p> Later in the day, I sometimes experiences cravings. I feel upset that the rest my junk food is locked up. When that happens I take a little time to remember how my past self limited the choices I have now because he cared about me, and how in the morning I will get to choose more junk food and then make the same commitment all over again, limiting the choices my next future self will have because I care about him. </p><p> The system is not perfect. It's <em>possible</em> to wedge my fingers through the crack in the box and pull out small items. Junk food is sometimes available from other sources throughout the day, and in those moments I have to choose again. Sometimes I choose restraint, and sometimes I choose indulgence. It's still a very good system. It's a good deterrent, and also a reminder to make conscious choices. </p><h2>What goes in the box</h2><p> It's good to talk about how to make healthy choices, and it's important to celebrate when we make them. I think it's also good to celebrate the unhealthy things we choose to enjoy in moderation along the way. With that in mind, I'll close with a few of my favorite chocolatey snacks. </p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Bag of Ghirardelli dark chocolate baking chips" height="105" src="baking-chips.jpg" title="Ghirardelli dark chocolate baking chips" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Ghirardelli dark chocolate baking chips</div><div> Dark chocolate baking chips usually sell for less than chocolate marketed for direct consumption, but they taste just as good. They mix well with nuts, Cheerios, or Nutella. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Cadbury mini eggs in a bag" height="105" src="cadbury-mini-eggs.jpg" title="Cadbury mini eggs" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Cadbury mini eggs</div><div> Seasonal in grocery stores, but always available in large bags on Amazon.

We can't fundamentally change that arc, but we can bend it a little bit, this way or that. We have some small say in the quality of life we experience along the way. </p></div><hr class="top-gapped"><div class="author"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Steven Baldasty</div><div class="caption">Proud father, Barefoot runner, Chocolate enthusiast, Seasoned software engineer, Starry eyed PhD student, Novice human</div></div><img src="/selfie.png" title="Sketch courtesy of my daughter" alt="Handsome brown haired man with glasses" width="80" height="88"></div></body></html>
