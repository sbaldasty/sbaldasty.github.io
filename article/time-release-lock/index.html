In theory, I could enjoy eating just enough food. I could enjoy sharing meals with family and friends. I could enjoy the health benefits good nutrition brings. In practice, the draw toward delicious tastes is powerful. Sugar especially offers a strange temporarily escape from stress and sadness. In my younger years I ate chocolate by the bar. I ate ice cream by the carton. I ate it in the morning. I ate it alone at night. Together with aging and a more sedentary lifestyle, my choices began to affect energy level and mood. Eventually they began to affect my weight.</p><p>Even though I wanted to eat less sugar, I could not control myself. Willpower helped somewhat. People encouraged me, which helped somewhat. I eventually learned about commitment devices - mechanisms that enabled people to make a choice in the present to limit what choices they have in the future. A time release lock is a classic example of a commitment device. It is a lock that requires no key or combination; instead, it opens automatically when a timer expires. Time release locks are often used to control access to cigarettes and addictive prescription medicines. They work well for junk food too.</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>I buy any junk food I like and can find at an acceptable price. I keep it all in one container. Any container with a hole for the shackle of the lock to slip through would do, but I use a large repurposed toolbox. I had it on-hand, and it allows me lots of space. In the morning, I enjoy choosing a reasonable amount of junk food from the container to last me the day. I give myself plenty of leeway about what <em>reasonable</em> means. After all, I only want to avoid overindulgence, not to punish myself. After that I make my commitment by locking the container. I allow myself to eat my chosen junk food any time I want, but I usually eat some after breakfast and the rest after lunch.</p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Holding an open time release lock" height="105" src="open-time-release-lock.jpg" title="Basic features" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Basic features</div><div> I bought this time release lock on Amazon. It is sturdy and has worked reliably for several years. It has a simple digital display, and buttons for setting and starting the timer. It beeps, but the beeping can be silenced. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Open toolbox filled with chocolate and other candy" height="105" src="toolbox-of-chocolate.jpg" title="Stocking the container" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Stocking the container</div><div> I restock infrequently to minimize my free access to junk food; but when I do, I fill the container completely. This way I can also take advantage of good sales and bulk deals. </div></div></div><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Closed time release lock with timer set to 20 hours" height="105" src="time-release-lock-timer.jpg" title="Setting the timer" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Setting the timer</div><div> I set the timer for about 20 hours.

If the battery runs out of charge, the lock cannot open again until it is at least partially recharged. </div></div></div></div><h2>Reflection</h2><p>My future self sometimes experiences cravings. He sometimes feels upset that the rest the junk food is locked up. When that happens I take a little time to remember how my past self limited the choices I have now because he cared about me, and how in the morning I will get to choose more junk food and then make the same commitment all over again, limiting the choices my next future self will have because I care about him.</p></div><hr class="top-gapped"><div class="author"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Steven Baldasty</div><div class="caption">Proud father, Barefoot runner, Chocolate enthusiast, Seasoned software engineer, Starry eyed PhD student, Novice human</div></div><img src="/selfie.png" title="Sketch courtesy of my daughter" alt="Handsome brown haired man with glasses" width="80" height="88"></div></body></html>
