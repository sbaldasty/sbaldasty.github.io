An internet search for him today turned up only a brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biography" target="blank_">biography</a> and an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anci/AnciStra.htm" target="blank_">ethics paper</a> he wrote.</p><p>You have reached the landing page of a live experiment whose goal is to develop by trial and error a genre of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map" target="blank_">argument map</a> that goes beyond little boxes with terse phrases inside them, connected by arrows and forming a tree. When fully developed, this document organizes beliefs into a web of connected claims. Each claim has a dedicated page containing discussion, citations, and links to other claims that support or challenge it.</p><h2>Table of contents</h2><p class="bottom-gapped">There is only one argument map, but the argument map may have multiple landing pages. Each landing page lists key beliefs about a topic to explore.</p><div class="headline"><div class="title-link"><a href="/argmap/landing/earth-shape/">The shape of the earth</a></div><div class="summary">People held different beliefs about the shape of the earth throughout history.
