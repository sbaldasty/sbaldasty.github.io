When fully developed, this is a document that organizes things people believe into a web of connected claims. Each claim gets its own page which lists other claims people offer as reasons for believing it, other claims that people give for disbelieving it, plenty of discussion, and hopefully lots of citations.</p><h2>Table of contents</h2><p class="bottom-gapped">There is only one argument map, but the argument map has multiple landing pages.
