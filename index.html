I was especially interested in techniques for proving things about the runtime behavior of software, and in how such techniques could be incorporated into an IDE and made usable enough for actual industry teams to adopt. </p><p> My first semester I worked as a Teaching Assistant in the department's Computer Security Foundations and Computability & Complexity. My second semester I taught two sections of Introduction to Programming. Since then, my research focused on secure multiparty computation and adversarial machine learning. </p><div class="tech-list"><b>Tools:</b> <a class="tech" href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank_" title="Fairly ubiquitous programming language">python</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://mpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mpyc.html" target="blank_" title="Secure multi-party computation framework for Python">mpyc</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="blank_" title="Object oriented functional programming language for the JVM">scala</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="blank_" title="Open source perating system with many distributions">linux</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.antlr.org/" target="blank_" title="Parser generator that targets the JVM">antlr4</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://flower.ai/" target="blank_" title="Distributed deep learning framework for Python">flwr</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://ocaml.org/" target="blank_" title="Type-safe functional programming language">ocaml</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://rocq-prover.org/" target="blank_" title="Interactive proof assistant">coq</a></div></div></div><div class="job"><div><div class="company">Asure Software</div><div class="location">Burlington, VT</div><div class="position">Sr. Software Engineer</div><div class="dates"><span class="date">2020</span> to <span class="date">2023</span></div></div><div class="exposition"><p> Asure provided time tracking and payroll services to small and medium size businesses. I helped maintain our time and attendance product, mostly characterized by making small changes to brittle legacy code. I also contributed to Azure CI/CD pipelines for our applications. </p><p> Additionally, our team maintained a system that used timeclocks and facial recognition. I helped maintain the applications associated with that system and built an ETL process and analytics dashboard to track the performance of our facial recognition time clocks. </p><p> My favorite innovation was a .NET adaptation of the Guava library's <i>range set</i> to simplify our business logic around sets of time intervals. I left Asure to work full time on my PhD. </p><div class="tech-list"><b>Tools:</b> <a class="tech" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="blank_" title="Java-like language for the Mircosoft .NET framework">c#</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="blank_" title="Cloud platform from Microsoft">azure</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="blank_" title="Cloud platform from Amazon">aws</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform" target="blank_" title="Manages cloud infrastructure as code">terraform</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server" target="blank_" title="Relational database management server from Microsoft">mssql</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="blank_" title="Browser-side scripting language for web applications">javascript</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank_" title="Fairly ubiquitous programming language">python</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://robotframework.org/" target="blank_" title="Develops procedures by mapping phrases to Python code">robotframework</a></div></div></div><div class="job"><div><div class="company">QGenda</div><div class="location">South Burlington, VT</div><div class="position">Sr. Software Engineer</div><div class="dates"><span class="date">2019</span> to <span class="date">2020</span></div></div><div class="exposition"><p> QGenda sold a SAAS physician scheduling system.

I rewrote a portion of our database-intensive rule checking engine to efficiently calculate <i>degrees of compliance</i> for the objective function. I designed an architecture using AWS Batch for triggering and monitoring off-node Opt4J scheduling jobs from within our user-facing Tomcat application. </p><div class="tech-list"><b>Tools:</b> <a class="tech" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="blank_" title="Java-interoperable language for the JVM">kotlin</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="blank_" title="Object oriented programming language targeting a virtual machine">java</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="blank_" title="Open source relational database management server">postgres</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" target="blank_" title="Version control management system">mercurial</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank_" title="Manages partition tables on a disk">git</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="blank_" title="Browser-side scripting language for web applications">javascript</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="blank_" title="Web-based user interfaces for Java applications">zk</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://vaadin.com/" target="blank_" title="Web-based user interfaces for Java applications">vaadin</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://junit.org/" target="blank_" title="Unit testing framework for the JVM">junit</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html" target="blank_" title="Object relational mapper spec for the JVM">jpa</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://ebean.io/" target="blank_" title="Object relational mapper for the JVM">ebean</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/" target="blank_" title="Language for XML transformations">xslt</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://sdarg.github.io/opt4j/" target="blank_" title="Evolutionary computation framework for the JVM">opt4j</a>, <a class="tech" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="blank_" title="Open source perating system with many distributions">linux</a></div></div></div><div class="job"><div><div class="company">Dealer.com</div><div class="location">Burlington, VT</div><div class="position">Jr. Software Engineer</div><div class="dates"><span class="date">2011</span> to <span class="date">2014</span></div></div><div class="exposition"><p> Dealer.com provided customer-facing websites and other services to automotive dealerships.
