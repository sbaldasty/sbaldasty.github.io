I live in Vermont where I enjoy wandering in forests, exploring ideas, having everyday adventures, and indulging a healthy dose of silliness. I try to live lightly and be kind. I'm thankful for my friends, family, and significant other. </p><div class="sparse-gallery"><div class="glimpse"><img alt="Me and Spot posing for a picture" height="105" src="robot-dog.jpg" title="Hanging out with a robotic dog at UVM" width="140"><div class="exposition"><div class="title">Hanging out with a robotic dog at UVM</div><div> A Boston Dynamics robotic dog who works as a photographer taking pictures of equipment at Global Foundries with a thermal imaging camera visited campus for a recruiting event. </div></div></div></div><p> This site is a home on the Internet for some of the projects I have done, for some of my writing, and for whatever else I choose to add. Everything here is always a work in progress. </p><p> I also welcome the opportunity to connect professionally. I have a long history in software development, and am curious what new and exciting ideas people and companies are pursuing to make the world a better place - using information technology or otherwise. With that in mind, here is a bit of a resume. </p><h2>Professional experience</h2><p class="bottom-gapped"> Technology changed a lot over my software career. Many of the skills that were important in my early years are not as important today, and many important skills I have today did not exist when I started. Constant throughout though, and something I believe will remain a constant well into the future, is that stakeholders need reliable innovative systems and efficient processes (software and otherwise) to move their goals forward. Success in business or research is a game of forever learning and exploring, always increasing the chances that decisions made will turn out to be good ones. It is a game I love to play, and I am lucky that there have always been interesting problems to solve. </p><div class="job"><div><div class="company">University of Vermont</div><div class="location">Burlington, VT</div><div class="position">Graduate Research &amp; Teaching Assistant</div><div class="dates"><span class="date">2023</span> to <span class="date">2025</span></div></div><div class="exposition"><p> I joined the PhD program at UVM to follow my dream of helping discover interesting ideas in computer science, and to improve my math skills.
