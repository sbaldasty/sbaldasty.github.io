<p>
Humans and machines create far more content than anyone can consume.
Some opens hearts and minds.
Some promotes creativity.
Some leads down dark paths.
What have I read lately that interested me?
What have I heard that inspired me?
What have I watched that touched me?

Choreographies describe interactions between processes in distributed systems.
Inference rules translate a choreography into the many possible traces (message passing sequences) that arise from concurrency.
Choreographic programming language constructs help avoid <i>starvation</i> and promote <i>compliance</i> and <i>conformance</i> in processes.
Some languages even produce independent executable build artifacts per process.

Differential privacy usually balances the <i>utility of a dataset</i> with the privacy of the individuals in it.
In the secure messaging system Vuvuzela, differential privacy balances the privacy of the users with the <i>efficiency of the system</i> in terms of compute, latency, and network traffic.
The percent confidence a powerful adversary can gain over many rounds that Alice and Bob ever communicated translates nicely into the privacy parameter &epsilon;.
