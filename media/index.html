They engage in inscrutible animated banter, squabble, and amuse themselves by playing with the artifacts. Fragments of the demolished planet Earth drift past the spaceship window. A lighthearted fifteen minutes of fun and indifference at the end of all human conflict, hope, despair, love, and life. </div></div><div class=title-link><a class=title-link href=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-choreographies/65D3DA3CFF11AB835452CBC97FAE4830 target=_blank>Introduction to choreographies</a></div><div class=media><div><div><img src=/media/text.png alt=Document title=Text width=24px height=32px></div><div class=date>2025-02-22</div></div><div> Choreographies describe interactions between processes in distributed systems. Inference rules can translate a choreography into the many possible traces (message passing sequences) that arise from concurrency. Choreographic programming language constructs avoid <i>starvation</i> and promote <i>compliance</i> and <i>conformance</i>. Through <i>endpoint projection</i> they produce independent executable build artifacts per process. </div></div><div class=title-link><a class=title-link href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/vuvuzela:sosp15.pdf target=_blank>Vuvuzela: Scalable private messaging resistant to traffic analysis</a></div><div class=media><div><div><img src=/media/text.png alt=Document title=Text width=24px height=32px></div><div class=date>2025-02-11</div></div><div> Differential privacy usually balances the <i>utility of a dataset</i> with the privacy of the individuals in it. In the secure messaging system Vuvuzela, differential privacy balances the privacy of the users with the <i>efficiency of the system</i> in terms of compute, latency, and network traffic. The percent confidence a powerful adversary can gain over many rounds that Alice and Bob ever communicated translates nicely into the privacy parameter &epsilon;. </div></div></body></html>
